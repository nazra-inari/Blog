    "**Official documentation:** https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html  \n",
    "**Description:** The count vectorizer function is intended to be used with text data to help convert data such as sentences into meaningful features for machine learning algorithms. In essence, the function counts the frequency of each word in each data-point/row of the data and adds it as a feature.   \n",

    "#### Parameters\n",
    "There are 5 parameters that we used above to initialize our CountVectorizer object:  \n",
    "***\n",
    "**input:** which is the data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**lowercase:** ensures that each word in our data is first converted to lowercase before it is processed  \n",
    "\n",
    "**stop_words:**  which ensures that generic words such as \"the\", \"and\", \"at\", etc are ignored  \n",
    "\n",
    "**ngram_range(a,b):** helps decide how many characters or words will be used per feature. If you set a = 1 and b = 2, then single words and pairs of adjacent words will be used to form the features. *There are examples for both below.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**analyzer:** this parameter can take values of 'word', 'char' or 'char_wb'. They respectively help the tokenizer decide whether a feature to be considered is a word, or a character.  The ngram_range would then respectively be applied to words or characters. The difference between 'char' and 'char_wb' is how the . tokenizer thinks of word boundaries. For instance, for an n-gram = 2, the word 'stop' would be tokenized as 'st', 'to', 'op' when the analyzer is set to 'char'. However, if set to 'char_wb' it would be tokenized as ' s', st', 'to', 'op', 'p '. In essence, thee characters at the word boundaries are padded with white spaces.    \n",

    "Once initialized, the CountVectorizer object has many functions/methods that you could take advantage of; some important ones to keep in consideration are:  \n",
    "**fit -** which can be used to fit our count vectorizer object to our data   \n",
    "**fit_transform -** which fits the count vectorizer  object to your data and also returns the respective term-document matrix in sparse matrix form. Hence, to be able visualize it, you will need to convert it to an array and then a dataframe with appropriate column and index names.  "
